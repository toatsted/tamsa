As a Commission, we were tasked with making recommendations on an assessment and accountability system that affects over 5 million students. I simply want to ensure that we have a robust report of actionable recommendations to provide to the legislature and Governor that reflect the next generation.

7,Governor Abbott Vetoes Senate Bill 313, 6/21/2015 ,"In his veto of SB 313, Governor Abbott missed an opportunity to expedite a review of the curriculum and the alignment of that curriculum with state assessments.&nbsp; SB 313&nbsp;in part would have prompted the State Board of Education (SBOE)&nbsp;to&nbsp;review&nbsp;and narrow all of the TEKS in the foundation courses, ensured that assessments are properly aligned with the TEKS, and provided diagnostic information for student performance on STAAR assessment. To a certain extent, this bill would have affirmed what is already part of our law: the SBOE is charged with reviewing the TEKS, and the STAAR assessments must be aligned with the TEKS.&nbsp; SB 313 would not have changed the SBOE's authority. Under its current charge to review the TEKS, SBOE can and should narrow their scope. During the session, many testified that&nbsp;classroom time is spent speeding through a curriculum instead of examining real learning.&nbsp;In turn, TEA and the testing vendor have the obligation to ensure that STAAR assessments are aligned with what is taught in the classroom.&nbsp;Earlier this year TAMSA called for a moratorium on the administration of the US History STAAR test specifically because information brought to light that the test was not properly aligned.&nbsp; Many Texas legislative leaders have expressed doubt and concern about the current cohort of STAAR tests.&nbsp; The veto of SB 313 should not delay the timely review of the TEKS and the thorough examination and assurance that the STAAR tests are aligned with the TEKS.&nbsp;""TAMSA has long advocated for meaningful assessments as well as detailed, diagnostic information on the student's performance,"" said Therea Trevi&ntilde;o, TAMSA President.

8,2015 TAMSA Legislative Summary, 6/3/2015 ,"Dear TAMSA Members:Thanks for your continued involvement throughout the 2015 legislative session.&nbsp; There is no substitute for legislators hearing directly from parents and students about how their actions impact the classroom and holding them accountable for their decisions.&nbsp;The number of STAAR tests remains the same - no bill passed during the 2015 session decreased the number tests.&nbsp; In fact, Texas still:Requires two more tests in high school and three more in grades 3-8 than required by federal law.&nbsp;Attaches high stakes - grade advancement or graduation - to test performance; most states do not have high stakes nor are they required by federal law.&nbsp;While the legislative session is over, our task is not! Even between legislative sessions, parents need to continue communicating with their representatives and senators to remind them about what is going on in the classroom and what still needs to be addressed. Voters expect action.Below is a short summary of bills passed that impact testing. &nbsp;Please visit the attached links for a more detailed summary.SB 149: Graduation CommitteesAllows individual graduation committees, an alternative path to graduation, for students who have&nbsp;passed all courses for graduation but have failed 1 or 2 end-of-course assessments.&nbsp; Unless renewed next legislative session, this bill expires on September 1, 2017.HB 743 - Grades 3-8 TestingSets more reasonable time limitations on tests for younger children: require test design so 85% of 3rd-5th graders are able to complete the test in 120 minutes, and 85% of 6th-8th graders can finish tests in 180 minutes.&nbsp; Also requires tests be validated by an independent third party other than the vendor or TEA.HB 1164 - High School TestingLots of early possibilities in this bill (check the longer description on our website), but in final form this calls for a broad study evaluating the best way to assess writing, and leaving the formulaic statewide standardized tests in place.HB 2804 - Accountability and a New CommissionDoes not reform STAAR tests, but does change the criteria on which schools and districts are rated: currently 95% based on STAAR test scores, this bill limits test scores to only 55% of the evaluation.SB 313 - Review of the TEKS/CurriculumProvides for the State Board of Education (SBOE) to conduct a review and possible modification to narrow the content and scope of the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skill (TEKS) of each foundation curriculum subject. &nbsp;READ DETAILED LEGISLATIVE SUMMARYVOTES ON KEY BILLS&nbsp;",,,
8,TAMSA Seeking SB 149 Success Stories, 6/17/2015 ,"The passage of SB 149, which creates individual graduation committees for students who failed up to 2 End-of-Course exams, was a huge step forward for Texas students. Parents, students, educators and advocates from across the state convinced our Texas Legislature that one test on one day should not wipe out 4 years of work and accomplishments and should not serve as the basis for determining graduation. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this bill came with an expiration date. &nbsp;Over the next 2 years, we will be charged with demonstrating that this bill indeed benefits our children and our state. &nbsp;We intend to show our lawmakers that students who graduated under this bill were not only vibrant, hard-working students in high school, but they are also successful in their pursuits after graduation.To that end, TAMSA would like to gather stories of students who graduated under this bill. &nbsp;Those willing to help with this effort can send their information to samick@tamsatx.org. &nbsp;We need as much information as you are willing to share, ideally including:&nbsp;student strengthsinvolvement in high school (clubs, extra-curricular activities, etc.)gradesplans after high school, including schools attended or currently attending and/or progress toward careersAdditionally, for those willing, we would like to follow up with these students just before the next session to see how they are doing at that time. &nbsp;We feel confident that we'll have some great success stories from students who, without this bill, would not have graduated.We appreciate your help in this effort! &nbsp;&nbsp;",http://tamsatx.org/uploads/3/4/4/6/34460330/dawson_orr_senate_testimony_8-2014.pdf,,
9,The Demise of HB 1164, 5/28/2015 ,"Despite legislative acknowledgements that cramming formulaic responses into a 26 line bloc does not equate to good writing skills, legislators failed to replace the STAAR writing tests. They had an opportunity with HB 1164.&nbsp; Representative VanDeaver had responded to the clamor for a better way to evaluate writing skills by filing HB 1164. This bill would have required districts to assess students&rsquo; writing according to the TEKS (state standards). Districts could chose the evaluation method, including implementing a portfolio program. Students&rsquo; performances on writing assessments would be reported to parents and in the aggregate to campuses and the State. High school students would have to demonstrate satisfactory performance on the district&rsquo;s writing assessment to graduate. A STAAR language arts test would still have been administered, but the writing component would have been returned to the sanity of the classroom.&nbsp; However, that sanity vanished when the bill was transformed in the Senate. Apparently, districts are not to be trusted with evaluating students&rsquo; learning. Although HB 1164 passed the House unanimously, the Senate Education Committee members substituted it whole cloth with new language. The new language not only leaves in place the current STAAR writing tests but also leaves the authority to even consider an alternate way to assess writing well centralized at the state level. The Senate-passed version of HB 1164 provides for a study and a pilot program. TEA is to conduct a study for a year on alternate methods to assess writing and then institute a two-year pilot program with select districts. The grading of any alternate writing assessment would still take place at the state level.&nbsp; How very disappointing to us as parents and very frustrating to our students and teachers who have to bear the ultimate price of continuing to prep for the rigid 26-line STAAR writing tests!&nbsp; TAMSA had joined many others in coming to hearings and testifying in favor of the initial version of HB 1164. Dawson Orr, superintendent of Highland Park ISD, aptly captured the need to replace the STAAR writing test when he earlier stated: properly assessing writing cannot be a one-time event and cannot occur with a 26-line limit. (Sen. Ed. Committee, August 26, 2014). The testimony of those most attuned to the impact of STAAR tests in the classroom had seemingly no effect on the Senators. Instead of concrete action to replace the STAAR writing test, the Senate chooses to spend state resources on another study. If they had been paying attention, they would know that we already have plenty of studies and research that offer alternatives for writing assessments.&nbsp; We are quick to hold our schools accountable for our students&rsquo; learning. We need to be just as quick to hold our legislators accountable for the decisions that they make that impact our students&rsquo; learning. Legislators have recognized issues with the STAAR tests. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick stated &ldquo;we don't trust this test,"" and Senate Education Chairman Larry Taylor noted ""there seems to be some sort of disconnect between our test and real student capabilities."" Yet, the Senators still want to hold students accountable in a punitive fashion for a test that leadership does not trust. Even if a study is desired, at least the high stakes should have been removed while alternative assessments were being considered. TAMSA urges that the primary focus of education policy should always be what is in the best interest of children. That focus is hard to find in the final version of HB 1164.&nbsp;READ STATEMENT FROM REPRESENTATIVE VAN DEAVERTAMSA-DEMISE OF HB 1164 (PDF)",,,

12,Legislative Update, 5/2/2015 ,"Key Legislative Bill Update May 1, 2015 TAMSA has followed, supported, and testified on dozens of bills this legislative session.&nbsp; As a practical matter, bills that have not been heard in committee by now have little chance of moving forward.&nbsp; The following bills are the key active bills related to testing effective May 1, 2015. SB 149 Seliger (R) This bill would establish an individual graduation committee (IGC) for each high school student who has met all high school graduation requirements but has failed to perform satisfactorily on EOCs in no more than two courses.&nbsp; When the individual graduation committee is convened, it will evaluate the student&rsquo;s performance in the class, as well as a number of other factors, and can require additional work.&nbsp; However, the student may qualify to graduate with a high school diploma if the judgment of the IGC is unanimous.&nbsp; This bill has passed both the House and the Senate, and Governor Abbott has until May 9, 2015 to sign or veto. Also, if the Governor does not act, the bill goes into effect.  SB 451 Seliger (R) /HB 774 Gonzalez (D)&nbsp;These companion bills would eliminate writing and social studies assessments in grades 3-8.&nbsp; Neither bill has received a hearing in the education committees. SB 1200 &nbsp;Taylor (R)/HB 4028 Huberty (R) - &nbsp;&nbsp;Creation of Next Generation Assessment and Accountability Commission.&nbsp; This commission would be composed of 7 members appointed by the Governor, 4 members appointed by the Lt. Gov, and 4 appointed by the Speaker.&nbsp; The charge is to develop and make recommendations for new systems of student assessment and school accountability.&nbsp; A report to the Legislature would be due Dec 1, 2016.&nbsp; The senate bill was voted out of the Senate on April 30, 2015 and referred to the House. SB 1302 Menendez (D) This bill would have TEA develop student assessments for grades 3-8 only in subjects required by federal law.&nbsp; This bill was heard in the Senate Education Committee on April 28, 2015, but has not yet been referred to the floor for a vote. HB 742 Huberty (R)&nbsp;This bill would eliminate the writing and social studies assessment in 3-8 and eliminate the US History EOC.&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill has been amended only to eliminate 8th grade Social Studies test.&nbsp; It was voted out of House Public Education Committee but not yet set for vote on the floor. HB 743 Huberty (R)&nbsp;This bill covers two issues: testing and the TEKS. The testing portion would call for the STAAR tests in grades 3-8 to be redesigned so that 85% of students in grades 3-5 are be able to complete the test in 2 hours and 85% of students in grades 6-8 can complete the test in 3 hours. The other portion of this bill calls for TEA to review the TEKS and, have the SBOE review the results and provide recommendations to the legislature, based on the review. An Advisory Committee would be formed to oversee the SBOE&rsquo;s report, and this committee would have the authority to conduct additional study if needed. The SBOE is to limit the TEKS to readiness standards for assessment. Supporting standards would be eliminated from the tests. The bill calls for an independent entity to review the revised tests on readiness standards.&nbsp;&nbsp; This bill was voted out of the House May 1, 2015.&nbsp;  HB 1162 VanDeaver (R) This bill would eliminate the requirement that students reach a satisfactory level of achievement on EOC assessments to graduate from high school.&nbsp; The bill specifies that the results of an EOC assessment may not be used as criteria for grade promotion or graduation but rather may be used only for purposes of diagnosing academic strengths and deficiencies of a student and guiding future specific instruction. The bill also provides for students to be exempt from certain EOC assessments for performance in alternative assessments.&nbsp; This bill has not been heard in the Public Education Committee. HB 1164 VanDeaver (R) This bill would replace the writing assessment for grades 3-12 with an English language arts assessment.&nbsp; The bill specifies that writing would still be assessed, but any writing sample submitted by a student as part of an assessment could not be used for accountability, grade promotion, or graduation requirement.&nbsp; The bill allows school districts to choose the method by which to assess students writing skills in grades four and seven and at the end of English I and English II secondary-level courses, including portfolio assessment.&nbsp; This bill was voted out of the House on April 30, 2015, and has been sent to the Senate. HB 2804 Aycock (R) This bill revises the accountability system.&nbsp; It institutes A-F ratings for schools.&nbsp; It also requires that testing count no more than 55% of school accountability.&nbsp; This bill was voted out of the House Education Committee and may be heard on the House floor soon.&nbsp;",,,

21,Compelling STAAR Writing Testimony From Highland Park Superintendent, 8/31/2014 ,"During the August 26 Senate Education Committee hearing, Dr. Dawson Orr,&nbsp;Superintendent of Highland Park ISD, outlined critical issues with&nbsp;current STAAR writing assessments and offered solutions for&nbsp;consideration. &nbsp;During his testimony, he explained how the current&nbsp;assessment model, which utilizes a 26-line first draft approach, is not&nbsp;capable of providing useful data about the status of students&rsquo; writing&nbsp;ability. &nbsp;He also questioned the correlation between STAAR and other,&nbsp;more established measures of writing, noting that higher percentages of&nbsp;students in Highland Park ISD were considered college-ready based on ACT&nbsp;and AP scores as compared to STAAR writing scores. In particular, in Dr.&nbsp;Orr's very high performing district, 98% of the high school graduates&nbsp;attend college. &nbsp;Yet from the most recent STAAR EOC results, STAAR&nbsp;suggested that approximately one-third of those same students are not&nbsp;college ready. &nbsp;Dr. Orr stated, ""We simply don't have confidence in&nbsp;STAAR as an accurate measure of skill or as a predictor of future&nbsp;success.""

They also passed a bill to fix this issue for 3rd graders, but it was vetoed, in part, due to concerns about our compliance with a Federal program.Yes, you read that right. Texas cannot make changes to OUR testing program because of a FEDERAL program."" &nbsp;Jeff Weiss of the Dallas Morning News has posted the entire press release on his education blog, found here.TAMSA believes that the federal No Child Level Behind program promotesthe overuse of standardized testing. &nbsp;We support SBOE Board memberThomas Ratliff&rsquo;s call for states to be allowed to set the number oftests they deem appropriate for assessing their students' learning needs.&ldquo;Texas, and other states, should have the right to determine what isthe best level of testing for students. We should not be hamstrung bythe U.S. Department of Education,&rdquo; said Dineen Majcher, president ofTAMSA, Texans Advocating for Meaningful Student Assessment. ""Texasparents and educators know what is best for Texas students - not theU.S. Department of Education.""TAMSA, a nonpartisan, statewide organization of parents, tapped agroundswell of opposition to the plethora of standardized studenttests and successfully advocated for a reduction in state high schooltesting requirements during the last legislative session.&ldquo;We would have seen more reduction for elementary and middle schoolstudents but beneficial legislation was vetoed. This was in partbecause of concern that Texas would lose valuable federal educationdollars tied to NCLB,&rdquo; Majcher said.&ldquo;Take down that wall,&rdquo; she summed up. &ldquo;Let Texas decide what is bestfor Texas.&rdquo;READ JEFF WEISS' EDUCATION BLOG POST WITH RATLIFF'S PRESS RELEASE",,,

Over the course of the next several weeks, students and parents will be receiving the results from these exams. The results should be considered benchmarks, not the end-all to learning for the year.

They spoke to PTAs and educator groups and set up social media sites. Soon, hundreds could be summoned to a hearing with a tweet. This session, with TAMSA fully engaged, a bill carried by Patrick and Rep. Jimmie Don Aycock, R-Killeen, scaled back end-of-course tests from 15 to 5. It passed both chambers unanimously.

39,TEA Requests NCLB Waiver on 8th Grade Algebra I Testing, 11/6/2013 ,"Commissioner Williams asks that Texas be allowed to use the Algebra I EOC test as the single subject area assessment in middle school. A waiver amendment is necessary to accommodate the lack of high school mathematics assessment results for middle school students who have appropriately completed their high school graduation requirements in mathematics prior to entering high school.Without federal approval, Texas middle school students (primarily those in the 8th&nbsp;grade) taking Algebra I will have to take a grade-level assessment to meet federal requirements as well as the state's Algebra I EOC to meet high school graduation requirements. Such double testing would begin this school year.Read the TEA Press Release and download Commissioner Williams' letter Excerpt from Commissioner Williams' letter to U.S. Dept. of Education: ""To avoid these negative consequences for our middle school students taking the STAAR Algebra I EOC test, Texas wishes to use the appropriate mathematics assessment, the Algebra I EOC test, to evaluate the academic performance of the middle school campus. For the reasons described above, Texas does not wish to attribute the same Algebra I test score to these students&rsquo; future high school campuses since the high school campus cannot be legitimately held accountable (favorable or not) for the performance of those students. Therefore, I request that the conditional waiver be amended to accommodate the lack of high school mathematics assessment results for middle school students who have appropriately completed their high school testing requirements in mathematics prior to entering high school.Since Texas state law now allows a portion of Texas students to complete part of their testing requirements for high school graduation prior to entering high school, this approach is the only instructionally appropriate and valid evaluation of mathematics for Texas middle schools and high schools.""

HB5 permits districts to give ONLY TWO (2) benchmark tests per year per subject tested. If you have any concerns about benchmarks in your child's school, check with your principal and school district board of trustees. The relevant statutory section applies beginning with the 2013-2014 school year and reads as follows: ADMINISTRATION OF DISTRICT-REQUIRED BENCHMARK ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR STATE-ADMINISTERED ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS. (a) In this section, ""benchmark assessment instrument"" means a district-required assessment instrument designed to prepare students for a corresponding state-administered assessment instrument.(b)&nbsp; Except as provided by Subsection (c), a school district may not administer to any student more than two benchmark assessment instruments to prepare the student for a corresponding state-administered assessment instrument.(c)&nbsp; The prohibition prescribed by this section does not apply to the administration of a college preparation assessment instrument, including the PSAT, the ACT-Plan, the SAT, or the ACT, an advanced placement test, an international baccalaureate examination, or an independent classroom examination designed or adopted and administered by a classroom teacher.(d)&nbsp; A parent of or person standing in parental relation to a student who has special needs, as determined in accordance with commissioner rule, may request administration to the student of additional benchmark assessment instruments.",http://www.hudsonisd.net/education/components/scrapbook/default.php?sectiondetailid=7378&backPath=L2VkdWNhdGlvbi9jb21wb25lbnRzL3NlYXJjaC9zZWFyY2gucGhwP3NlY3Rpb25kZXRhaWxpZD04,,
